# ML_Projects

Welcome to my machine learning project repository! ðŸš€  

In this collection of projects, I explore various machine learning algorithms and techniques to solve real-world problems. Each project is aimed at demonstrating the application of different algorithms, from traditional models like linear regression and decision trees to more advanced techniques like neural networks and ensemble methods.  

Feel free to explore the projects and dive into the code. Contributions, feedback, and suggestions are always welcome!  Happy coding! ðŸ¤–âœ¨
